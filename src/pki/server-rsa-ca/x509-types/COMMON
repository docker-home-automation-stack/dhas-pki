# X509 extensions added to every signed cert

# This file is included for every cert signed, and by default does nothing.
# It could be used to add values every cert should have, such as a CDP as
# demonstrated in the following example:

authorityInfoAccess     = caIssuers;URI:http://example.com/pki/ca.crt,OCSP;URI:http://ocsp.example.com
crlDistributionPoints   = URI:http://example.com/pki/crl.pem,URI:http://example.com/pki/crl.pem;
