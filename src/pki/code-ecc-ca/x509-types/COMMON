# X509 extensions added to every signed cert

# This file is included for every cert signed, and by default does nothing.
# It could be used to add values every cert should have, such as a CDP as
# demonstrated in the following example:

#crlDistributionPoints = URI:http://example.net/pki/code-ecc/ca.crl
#authorityInfoAccess = OCSP;URI:https://example.net/pki/ocsp/,caIssuers;URI:http://example.net/pki/code-ecc/ca.p7s
